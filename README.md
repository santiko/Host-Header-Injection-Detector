# Host-Header-Injection-Detector
(I developed this code this morning after pray Subuh).

This super simple tool is used to check whether the URL (main or subdomain) is vuln to inject with X-Forwarded-Host.
In this code, i wrote X-Forwarded-Host: google.com, feel free to modify it.

Wishes be useful for all.
